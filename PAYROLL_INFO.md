# What is Payroll?

**Payroll** is where employees can view their **salary information**.

## What Employees Can See:

1. **Base Wage** - Your basic monthly salary
2. **Total Allowances** - Extra payments (HRA, Transport, etc.)
3. **Total Deductions** - Money deducted (Tax, PF, etc.)
4. **Net Salary** - Final amount you receive (Take-home pay)

## Salary Components Breakdown:

The Payroll page shows a detailed table with:
- Component Name (e.g., HRA, Transport Allowance)
- Type (Percentage or Fixed amount)
- Value (e.g., 40% or ₹5000)
- Calculated Amount (Final rupees)

## Example:
```
Base Wage: ₹50,000
+ HRA (40%): ₹20,000
+ Transport: ₹2,000
- Tax (10%): ₹5,000
= Net Salary: ₹67,000
```

Employees can only **VIEW** their salary. Only Admin/HR can **EDIT** salary structures.
